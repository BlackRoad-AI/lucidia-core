**AI reasoning engines for specialized domains - physics, mathematics, chemistry, geology, and more.**

```bash
pip install lucidia-core
```

## What is this?

Lucidia is a collection of specialized AI reasoning agents, each modeled after a domain expert:

| Agent | Domain | Capabilities |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Physicist** | Physics | Energy modeling, force calculations, feedback systems |
| **Mathematician** | Mathematics | Symbolic computation, proofs, numerical analysis |
| **Chemist** | Chemistry | Molecular analysis, reactions, compound properties |
| **Geologist** | Geology | Terrain modeling, stratigraphy, resource mapping |
| **Analyst** | Data Science | Pattern recognition, insights, statistical analysis |
| **Architect** | Systems | Design blueprints, architecture planning |
| **Engineer** | Engineering | Structural analysis, calculations, optimization |
| **Painter** | Visual | Graphics generation, artistic rendering |
| **Poet** | Creative | Poetry, lyrical composition, narrative |
| **Speaker** | NLP | Speech synthesis, communication, translation |

## Quick Start

### CLI Usage

```bash
# List available agents
lucidia list

# Run the physicist agent
lucidia run physicist --query "Model energy flow in a thermal system"

# Start the API server
lucidia api --port 8000
```

### API Usage

```bash
# Start the server
lucidia-api

# Or with Python
python -m lucidia_core.api
```

Then query the agents:

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Physicist analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/physicist/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Calculate the energy required to heat 1kg of water from 20C to 100C"}'

# Mathematician computation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mathematician/compute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Solve x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0"}'
```

### Python Usage

```python
from lucidia_core import get_physicist, get_mathematician

# Load the physicist
PhysicistSeed, load_seed = get_physicist()
seed = load_seed("codex21.yaml")

# Load the mathematician
MathematicianSeed, load_seed = get_mathematician()
```

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |

## Configuration

Each agent is configured via a YAML "seed" file (e.g., `codex21.yaml` for Physicist):

```yaml
system_charter:
  agent_name: "Physicist"
  generation: "2024"
  domain: ["physics", "energy", "dynamics"]
  moral_constant: "preserve momentum gently"
  core_principle: "ground every run on measured observations"
```
